      // What is the last value alerted by this code? Why?
      // ANSWER: 1, the last loop before it stops, it decreases i = 1 to 
      // i = 0, when the condition is checked at i = 0, it's a falsy value
      // and then the while loop stops execution.

      let i = 3;

      while (i) {
        alert( i-- );
      }
