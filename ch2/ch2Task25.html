      // ANSWER the first and the third will execute
      // FIRST: (-1 || 0) -1 is truthy and that will return true and run the alert
      // SECOND: (-1 && 0) && return the last operand which is 0, i.e. falsy, alert will not run
      // THIRD: (null || -1 && 1) && has a higher precedence, -1 && 1 = 1, and 1 is truthy, third will execute.
