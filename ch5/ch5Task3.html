      // Why 6.35.toFixed(1) == 6.3?
      // ANSWER: Internally the decimal fraction 6.35 is an endless binary. As always in such cases, 
      // it is stored with a precision loss. Let’s see:
      // alert( 6.35.toFixed(20) ); // 6.34999999999999964473
      // The precision loss can cause both increase and decrease of a number. In this particular 
      // case the number becomes a tiny bit less, that’s why it rounded down.
