        An occasional infinite loop
        This loop is infinite. It never ends. Why?
        let i = 0;
        while (i != 10) {
          i += 0.2;
        }
      */

      // ANSWER: there is a loss of precision in JavaScript when adding decimals, it will never become 10 precisely

      /*
      That’s because i would never equal 10.

      Run it to see the real values of i:

      let i = 0;
      while (i < 11) {
        i += 0.2;
        if (i > 9.8 && i < 10.2) alert( i );
      }
      None of them is exactly 10.

      Such things happen because of the precision losses when adding fractions like 0.2.

      Conclusion: evade equality checks when working with decimal fractions.
